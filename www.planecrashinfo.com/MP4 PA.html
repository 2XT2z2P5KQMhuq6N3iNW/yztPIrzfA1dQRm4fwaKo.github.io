<span class="style4">The military jet crashed and was destroyed while attempting to land in dense fog<br />
and poor visibility. The crew requested permission to carry out a trial approach to<br />
a decision height of 100 m and told the controller to expect a go-around. A few<br />
seconds before impact, the autopilot and autothrottle were disconnected in order<br />
to execute a go-around. The airplane impacted upsloping terrain at a distance of<br />
about 1,100 meters from the runway and 40 m to the left of extended centerline.<br />
The immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the crew to make a timely<br />
decision to proceed to an alternate airport although they were not once timely<br />
informed of the actual weather conditions at Smolensk, which were significantly<br />
lower than the established airport minima. Descent without visual contact with<br />
ground references to an altitude much lower than minimum descent altitude for<br />
a go-around,  in order to establish visual flight. No reaction to the numerous TAWS<br />
warnings which led to controlled flight into terrain, aircraft destruction and death<br />
of the crew and passengers.
  Polish president Lech Kaczynski and his wife were<br />
among the 96 people killed.</span></td>
