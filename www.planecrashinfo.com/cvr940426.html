<b>While on ILS approach to Nagoya Airport, at an altitude of 1,000 feet, the 
first officer inadvertently triggered the TOGA (take-off-go-around) lever. The 
crew tried to override this situation by turning off the autothrottle and 
reducing air speed. The aircraft stalled, hit the runway tail first and burst 
into flames. The plane crashed because of an extreme out of trim configuration 
brought about by the fact that the tailplane setting had moved automatically and 
undetected to a maximum nose-up position. The plane climbed at a steep angle 
until it stalled. The crew could have saved the aircraft even in the final 
seconds had they reverted to basic flight procedures and switched off the 
autopilot.&nbsp; Two-hundred-sixty-four out of 271 aboard were killed.</b></p>
