<b>On a flight from Chicago to Pittsburgh, while on approach, the aircraft went 
into a sudden nose dive and crashed into a wooded ravine 6 miles northwest of 
the airport. The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft 
resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an 
uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction 
opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder 
PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its 
neutral position and overtravel of the primary slide. All 132 aboard were 
killed.</b></p>
