<p class="style4">05:44:04.9<br>
  CAM-2 yeah howdy, like yeah, yeah * and then I kept thinking about it....<br>
  I guess, when I'm, I'm deciding on making a major decision, if it<br>
  doesn't feel right in my gut. or if I don't have a little voice, if it's<br>
  starts talking to me and I'm like I need to re-evaluate.</p>
<p class="style4">05:44:29.5<br>

  four dogs and I'm not, I'm not about to give up, I've had 'em for a<br>
