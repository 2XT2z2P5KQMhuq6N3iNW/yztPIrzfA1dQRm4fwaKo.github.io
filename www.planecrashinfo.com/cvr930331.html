EVV-1 four six Echo Evergreen ops, go ahead. </p>
<p>1248:24 {27:08} <br>
RDO-3 we did indeed lose number two engine and we have very hot brakes on the 
left side of the aircraft. how copy? </p>
<p>1248:32 {27:16} <br>
CAM-? yep, we sure as ## shucked number two engine, it's gone. </p>
<p>1248:34 {27:18} <br>
EVV-1 copy all. you on the blocks now? </p>
<p>1248:35 {27:19} <br>

<p>1248:55 {27:39} <br>
CAM-3 OK. you got it. </p>
<p>1248:57 {27:41} <br>
CAM-1 saved my butt. </p>
<p>1248:58 {27:42} <br>
CAM-3 OK, everybody did. </p>
<p>1249:01 {27:45} <br>
CAM-1 ***** had this problem **** and it didn't get any better** turbulence ****
</p>
<p>1249:05 {27:49} <br>
CAM-3 I want pictures. --- um, what were we doing? --- guess we can crank the 
APU. </p>
<p>1249:18 {28:02} <br>
CAM-1 go ahead and get the APU running. </p>
<p>1249:22 {28:06} <br>
CAM-2 I asked them to come closer. </p>
<p>1249:24 {28:08} <br>
CAM-3 number four's steady, number one hydraulics? </p>
<p>1249:31 {28:15} <br>
CAM-? the the gauge is just going in circles** </p>
<p>1249:34 {28:18} <br>
CAM-3 OK. that was like, look at his gauges ** I'm just gonna crank the APU and 
we'll see what happens ------ it's out over the water at least hopefully. no 
actually, it's over Anchorage somewhere. we took off on six left and hit all 
that # **** </p>
<p>1249:41 {28:25} <br>
CAM-1 OK, uh, everybody. </p>
<p>1250:03 {28:47} <br>
CAM-3 yes. </p>
<p>1250:05 {28:49} <br>
CAM-1 we need to gart start gettin' our story right so we can start detailing 
everything that happened. </p>
<p>1250:08 {28:52} <br>
CAM-3 OK, let's, do you wanna get blocked in first, or, do you wanna do it now?
</p>
<p>1250:11 {28:55} <br>
CAM-1 *** just thinking about it, no we're gonna get blocked in, and everything 
secured so we won't catch the ## on fire from the brakes. </p>
<p>1250:17 {29:01} <br>
CAM-3 it was eighteen hundred feet is where we first started catching the # is 
what I saw. APU is start, check. Now we got indications all over the place it's 
real weird #. </p>
<p>1250:30 {29:14} <br>
CAM-1 ya, well </p>
<p>1250:32 {29:16} <br>
CAM-3 including a wing overheat on the left side. can we turn off the air? </p>
<p>1250:37 {29:21} <br>
CAM-1 I don't, I don't know if the turbulence ripped that engine loose or ***.
</p>
<p>1250:40 {29:24} <br>
CAM-2 it did. I think**** </p>
<p>1250:43 {29:27} <br>
CAM-1 **** or it the engine blew and. </p>
<p>1250:47 {29:31} <br>
CAM-2 they want the other one, the other one. </p>
<p>1250:49 {29:331 <br>
CAM-1 turn off **** number one. </p>
<p>1250:53 {29:37} <br>
CAM-3 number one, it's two ADPs are comin' off. we've got a wing overheat. I'm 
taking all the air off the left wing. OK? </p>
<p>1250:59 {29:43} <br>
CAM-1 I'm sure we do. I'm sure we do. --- isolate the wing, please. </p>
<p>1251:07 {29:51} <br>
CAM-3 ya, it's isolated and ah, I'm gonna wait on the APU and all that crap. </p>
<p>1251:08 {29:52} <br>
CAM-2 you're lucky that that one didn't take the number one out. </p>
<p>1251:10 {29:54} <br>
CAM-1 yes, yes. we're real lucky. with all the parts that came off </p>
<p>1251:16 {30:00} <br>
CAM-3 I think everybody here is going to get their medical**** good thing no one 
drank last night, huh? </p>
<p>1251:23 {30:07} <br>
CAM-1 that's right. </p>
<p>1251:28 {30:12} <br>
CAM-3 OK, I don't know what you want**** </p>
<p>1251:31 {30:15} <br>
CAM-1 tell me to turn left, </p>
<p>1251:34 {30:18} <br>
RDO-3 Evergreen ops, we're going to need a power unit out here. we got overheat 
on the left wing also and we don't want to crank the APU so bring us the ground 
power unit. </p>
<p>1251:39 {30:23} <br>
CAM-1 I can turn left all day. ((simuftaneous with previous transmission)) down 
one and four. </p>
<p>1251:47 {30:31} <br>
RDO-3 OK, thanks. </p>
<p>1251:49 {30:33} <br>
CAM-3 um, I don't know, I don't have the APU cranked because of that wing 
leading edge overheat. </p>
<p>1251:52 {30:36} <br>
CAM-1 we gotta get these brakes off </p>
<p>1251:54 {30:38} <br>
CAM-3 OK. -- copy. -- number one and four comin' down. power's comin' off . </p>
<p>1251:57 {30:41} <br>

<p>1251:59 {30:43} <br>
INT-7 chocks are in. </p>
<p>1252:02 {30:46} <br>
INT-1 OK, we don't have an APU, we're powerin' it down right now. ah, brakes are 
very very hot. </p>
<p>1252:06 {30:50} --- power's coming off. <br>
CAM-3 OK, comin down three and four. </p>
<p>1252:10 {30:54} <br>
INT-7 copy that. you guys did a good job gettin' it in here. </p>
<p>1252:12 {30:56} <br>
CAM-2 number one radio can be on. </p>
<p>1252:13 {30:57} <br>
