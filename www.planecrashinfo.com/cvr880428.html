<b>The aircraft suffered separation of the top of the fuselage resulting in 
explosive decompression and severe structural damage. A flight attendant was 
sucked out of the opening in the fuselage and her body never recovered. The 
plane landed safely. Failure of Aloha Airlines' maintenance program to detect 
the presence of disbonding and fatigue damage which led to failure of the lap 
joint at S-10L and the separation of the fuselage upper lobe. Contributing 
factors were the failure of Aloha Airlines management to properly supervise its 
maintenance crew as well as the failure of the FAA to properly evaluate the 
Aloha Airlines maintenance program and to assess the airline's inspection and 
quality control deficiencies.&nbsp; </b></p>
