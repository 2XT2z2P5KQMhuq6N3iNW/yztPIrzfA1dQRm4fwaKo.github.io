<h1>Part III, other methods</h1>

<p><a name="hanging"><b>Hanging</b></a><br>
   1. asphyxiation (dangle on end of rope for 10 minutes)<br>
      Time:      5 to 10 minutes<br>
      Available: Rope, solid support 10 foot above ground<br>
      Certainty: Fairly certain (discovery, rope/support snapping)<br>
      Notes:     Brain damage likely if rescued. Very painful depending on
         rope. Most common effective form of suicide in UK. See "Asphyxiation".
<p>
   2. breaking neck<br>
      Time:      Should be instant if it does break. See previous if not<br>
      Available: Rope, solid support, 10 foot space below, several above<br>
      Certainty: Very certain if the rope/support doesn't break<br>
      Notes:     Minimal danger of discovery (depends on location). Painless
         if you drop far enough (8 foot is optimum). Make sure that the rope
         is tied securely to something STRONG!! It has to support your weight
         MULTIPLIED by the deccelleration. Use a hangman's knot (with the knot
         at the back of your neck). It doesn't always work this well though,
         you might get a bust jaw / lacerations etc and then asphyxiate.

	     a.s.h. long-time regular MegaZone (megazone@wpi.wpi.edu),
	     who got it from a friend of his named Mark.

<p>
	Notes: This is for person of average build with no unusual
	physical problems.  The Author (James "Hangman" Barry) noted
	that when executing "persons who had attempted suicide by
	cutting their throats...to prevent reoping the wounds I have
	reduced the drop by nearly half."
<p>


<p><a name="buildings"><b>Jumping off buildings</b></a><br>
   Time:      Instantanious if you are lucky, minutes/hours otherwise<br>
   Available: You need ten stories or higher, and access to the top floor
              windows/roof. Bring a bolt cutter to get onto the roof<br>
   Certainty: 90% for 6 stories, increasing after that<br>
   Notes:     Difficult to overcome fear of heights, many people can't do it.
      Totally painless if high enough, but very frightening. Easily discovered
      if seen on/near roof/windows. Access fairly easy in a city, otherwise
      difficult. Risk of spending the rest of your life in a wheelchair. Ever
      tried killing yourself if you are paralysed from the neck down? Email
      conversations suggest 10+ stories works ALMOST all of the time. Try to
      land on concrete. Quote - "9 out of 10 people who fall 6 stories will
      die". Note that it may take a while for many of those 90% to die.

<p><a name="wristcut"><b>Slitting wrists or other (often not effective)</b></a><br>
   Time:      Minutes if major artery cut, eternity otherwise.<br>
   Available: You really need a razor sharp knife. Razors are pretty tricky
              to hold when they are covered with blood.<br>
   Certainty: possible if you cut an artery, improbable otherwise<br>
   Notes:     Painful at first. Danger of discovery. This is a very common
      suicide 'gesture' and hardly ever results in anything other than a scar.
      A lot of will power required to cut deeply into groin or carotid
      arteries, which are the only ones likely to kill you. Don't bother with
      this method. Cutting your throat is difficult due to the fact that the
      carotid arteries are protected by your windpipe (feel where your arteries
      are with your fingertips, & slice from the side). I've seen photos of
      people who have used this method - the depth of the cut required is
      amazing. If you want to cut your wrists, cut along the blue line (vein)
      on the underside of your wrist, but cut deeply so that the artery
      underneath is exposed. Cut this lengthways with a razor or similar. The
      traditional hot bath does help, since it keeps the blood flowing quickly,
      slows down clotting, and is nice to lie back and relax in. Position
      yourself so that your wrists don't fall inwards against your body,
      blocking off blood flow.
<p>
      Calle: A posting to A.S.H. suggests using the kind of equipment
	     they use when you give blood to a blood bank, i.e., a
	     needle in a blood vessel and a piece of tubing. It sounds
	     like it would remove several of the disadvantages of the
	     ordinary slitting-wrists method.

<p><a name="bullet"><b>Bullet</b></a><br>
   Time:      Microseconds unless you are unlucky (mins/hours)<br>
   Available: Difficult in UK, easier in USA (get a shotgun)<br>
   Certainty: Certain<br>
   Notes:     Painless if worked, otherwise painful & brain damage.
      Danger of discovery of weapon or ammunition. Not at all common in UK,
      more common in USA where guns available. Brain damage & other effects if
      you survive. Death either instantaneous, or prolonged. Lots of will power
      needed to fire gun ('hesitation marks' are bullets/pellets embedded in
      the wall, when you jerk the gun as you fire). Bullet can miss vital parts
      in skull, deflect off skull. If you have a choice, use a shotgun rather
      than a rifle of a pistol, since it is so much more effective. ("shotgun"
      entry later). Ammunition to use is: .458 Winchester Magnum, or soft-point
      slugs with .44 Magnum. Also you could use a sabot round, which is a
      plastic wedge with a smaller thing in it. These rounds are rather
      overkill, the phrase "elephant gun" has been used about the .458
      Winchester, but if you're going to go, do it with a bang. Note, people
      usually survive single .22 shots to the temples. The other problem with
      guns is that is is bloody messy. Your next of kin will really _enjoy_
      cleaning up after you, washing the coagulated blood & brains out of
      corners etc...

<p><a name="asphyxiation"><b>Asphyxiation</b></a><br>
   Time:      5 mins to unconciousness, 10+ mins to brain death<br>
   Available: Anywhere there's a rope and something solid to tie it to<br>
   Certainty: Certain, if you don't get "rescued"<br>
   Notes:     Panic reaction is very likely (unless inert gasses used).
      One of the most effective and most used methods of suicide.
      Probable brain damage if you are "rescued".
      NOTE, this can only really be done in two ways: firstly,
      when you are unconsious (eg, sleeping pills), or secondly,
      by hanging. Combining with pure inert gasses is a very good
      suggestion. See "Nitrogen" in the poisons section

<p><a name="air"><b>Air in veins (basically just a myth)</b></a><br>
   Time:      Couple of minutes claimed<br>
   Available: Plenty of air about... Need a hypodermic & syringe<br>
   Certainty: only 1 known case.. patient may already have been dead<br>
   Notes:     The only case I know about, it killed with 40cc of air. Smaller
      amounts are harmless. The case was the death of Abbie Borroto,
      who died in 1950 from a 40cc injection in New Hampshire. She
      died in minutes. This was the 1949 Dr H Sander case. He was
      found not guilty to murder on the grounds that the patient may
      already have been dead when he gave the injection. (A doctor and
      a nurse could find no pulse earlier the same day).
      The following 2 quotes are from [1]:
      Prof. Y Kenis says: <i>"... not a suitable method, nor a gentle
      death... extremely difficult to utilize as a method of suicide.
      .. possibly with very serious consequences, such as paralysis or
      permanent brain damage. .. this is only an impression, and I have
      no real scientific information on the subject."</i>
      Dr Pieter V Admiraal .. describes the theoretical air bubble
      method of suicide as impossible, disagreeable and cruel. <i>"To
      kill somebody with air you would have to inject at least 100 ->
      200 millilitres as quickly as possible in a vein as big as
      possible close to the heart. You would have to fill the whole
      heart with air at once. The heart would probably beat on for
      several minutes, perhaps 5 -> 15 minutes, and during the first
      minutes the person may be conscious."</i>

<p><a name="decapitation"><b>Decapitation</b></a><br>
   Time:      Couple of seconds before conciousness fades<br>
   Available: Happen to have a train line nearby? Or a guillotine perhaps?<br>
   Certainty: Very certain, unless you pull away just before<br>
   Notes:     See "jumping in front of trains". May be difficult to stop
      pulling your head out of the way - OD on sleeping tablets
      first
<p>
   Calle: A news notice from California posted to alt.suicide.holiday
	  tells the story of a man who comitted suicide nearly cut his
	  own head off with a chainsaw. Sounds like a grisly way to do it. 

<p><a name="harakiri"><b>Disembowelment (aka seppuku/hara kiri)</b></a><br>
   Time:      Minutes<br>
   Available: Got a nice razor-sharp sword?<br>
   Certainty: Fairly certain, assuming that you managed to gut yourself
              properly before passing out with the agony<br>
   Notes:     Painful, even the macho Samurai used a 'second' to decapitate them
      at the appropriate point, so don't expect to do much more than
      give yourself peritonitis. Trendy for insane martial arts
      fanatics and gay Japanese poets called Mishima.

<p><a name="drowning"><b> Drowning</b></a><br>
   Time:      Minutes (5 mins to die of drowning, 20 to die of hypothermia)<br>
   Available: Anywhere there's deep, (cold) water in a remote spot<br>
   Certainty: Good, just make sure you sink & can't swim<br>
   Notes:     Put stones in your pockets, tie your legs & hands together,
      and hop into the lake.. bit of a shock to the fisherman who
      finds your rotting corpse stuck in his brand new net. Also see
      entry for "hypothermia/freezing".  However, remember that you can be
      revived from cold water drowning after several hours, because the cold
      slows down terminal brain damage. Warmer water doesn't have the advantage
      of hypothermia, but is more effective in making sure you *stay* dead.

<p><a name="electrocution"><b> Electrocution</b></a><br>
   Time:      Seconds / minutes<br>
   Available: Anywhere with high-tension, high-current lines & a good earth<br>
   Certainty: Somewhat dependant on luck & how much power goes through you<br>
   Notes:     Don't bother with 110 or 240 volt mains, its just not enough.
      Some people do get killed with household electricity, but only
      after several minutes. Use high tension lines, stand in bare
      feet on waterlogged ground (better still, put a piece of THICK
      copper cable into the nearest river). Works best if current
      path travels through your head, or through the heart. Just
      burns you badly otherwise.
      NOTE: people have survived massive high-voltage, high-current
      shocks with nothing but 3rd degree burns to show for it.
      Sometimes paralysis, limbs amputated etc.

<p><a name="explosives"><b> Explosives</b></a><br>
   Time:      10 milliseconds, or similar (!)<br>
   Available: Difficult to get hold of detonator & good explosives<br>
   Certainty: Certain if detonator works properly<br>
   Notes:     DON'T USE GUNPOWDER or other 'slow' explosives (eg,
      homemade explosives). Use dynamite or 'Plastique', strap
      it to your forehead with the detonator, and BOOM! The main
      problem is with getting hold of high explosives (I know the
      recipe for Nitro-Glycerine, but home manufacture is extremely
      risky, and the product is unstable). If you can get a grenade,
      use it, it's probably the best way of doing this one.
<p>
   Calle: Recipies for creating explosives can be found, together with
	  the appropriate warnings, in the rec.pyrotechnics FAQ.

<p><a name="hypothermia"><b> Freezing to death (hypothermia)</b></a><br>
   Time:      several hours (15 minutes in very cold water)<br>
   Available: Got a large chest freezer? Is the outside temp < -10 degrees?<br>
   Certainty: good if you don't get found<br>
   Notes:     Soak your cloths in water, get into freezer / outside
      somewhere where you won't be found. Helps to get pissed
      first - drink yourself silly. If you are near a very
      cold supply of water (eg, the North Sea, or similar) which is
      close to zero degrees, this is particularly good, since the
      average lifespan of someone in the water is 15 minutes.
      [1] says: ".. have quietly ascended their favorite mountain late
      in the day .. above the freezing line.. wearing light clothing,
      they sat down in a secluded spot to await the end. Some have said
      that they intended to take a tranquilizer to hasten the sleep of
      death. From what we know of hypothermia, they would pass out as
      the cold reached a certain level and they would die within a few
      hours. Of course in a very cold climate there is no need to climb
      a mountain." [eg, UK in midwinter :-). There was a death in the
      middle of the city park here just this last winter ('90) where a
      lady stripped after the park closed for the night.]  A problem with
      this method is that because it slows the metabolism, and prevents
      damage to the brain, people can be revived several hours after 'death'
      occasionally.

<p><a name="trains"><b> Jumping in front of trains</b></a><br>
   Time:      Seconds (or hours if unlucky)<br>
   Available: Anywhere near a HIGH-SPEED railway line<br>
   Certainty: Depends on your timing & speed of train. Go for decapitation<br>
   Notes:     Probably better to put your neck on the line, since a glancing
      blow would probably break your spine (& cripple you). High
      speed trains need a kilometer to stop, so find a blind corner.

<p><a name="immolation"><b> Self-immolation</b></a><br>
   Time:      Seconds to days<br>
   Available: Anywhere you can get petrol & a match<br>
   Certainty: good as long as you are far away from medical help<br>
   Notes:     bloody painful - one of the most agonising ways to die.
      If you do survive, you will be disfigured for the rest
      of your life.
      Try mixing the petrol with an explosive like TNT or NG,
      this will make it burn MUCH quicker, even if the explosive
      is very dilute.

<p><a name="starving"><b> Starving to death</b></a><br>
   Time:      40 days give or take. Depends on health.<br>
   Available: Anywhere where you can't be force-fed<br>
   Certainty: Good as long as no medical help & will power holds up<br>
   Notes:     Supposed to be easier after the first couple of days, since
      your appetite goes. In a UK prison, you can't be force-fed
      unless you give permission first, or are diagnosed insane,
      but I don't know whether this is the same in other countries.
      Beware - relatives might give permission on your behalf if you
      are unconsious. (living will / durable power of attorney helps).
      It may help if you use an appetite suppressant. Amphetamines,
      and some drugs (MDMA, AKA XTC, AKA ecstasy, AKA
      metheylenedimethoxymethamphetamine is one such). The problem with
      these is that they are frequently illegal. I've also heard of
      something called Aminorex (4-methylaminorex) which was briefly
      prescribed as an appetite suppressant, but taken off the market
      since it had fatal side effects... which is hardly a problem!!
      [1] says:<br>
      ".. after approximately 20 % of body weight loss, illness will
      begin to set in, notably severe indigestion, muscle weakness, and
      _worst of all_ mental incapacity. ... about 40 days before life
      is seriously theatened.    ...."<br>
      "In some cases self-starvation can be very painful. ... morphene
      had to be administered to kill the pain of fatal dehydration. .."

<p><a name="bridge"><b> Driving into bridge support at 100 mph</b></a><br>
   Time:      Hopefully instantanious<br>
   Available: Fast car, motorway, unprotected bridge....<br>
   Certainty: So-so, put a couple of cans of petrol on the passenger seat to
              make it certain, & USE YOUR SEATBELT<br>
   Notes:     Bridges are usually protected in the UK, don't know about USA.
      Avoid being thrown out of the car by using the seatbelt, and
      put petrol (in cans or just splashed about) near to the driver's
      seat just to make certain. Can be made to look accidental.

<p><a name="shotgun"><b> Shotgun</b></a><br>
   Time:      Instantanious if you are lucky<br>
   Available: Difficult in UK, easier in USA (due to gun laws)<br>
   Certainty: Fairly certain<br>
   Notes:     12-gauge shotgun with 3 inch Magnum shells with #2 to #000
      buckshot. See "Bullet" for other points. This is the recommended
      way to die by firearm. Apparently the shells suggested here
      are "extreme overkill", but thats the point really... problem
      here is that its amazingly messy - who is going to pick the
      festering lumps of gore out of the carpet?  Another problem is that it
      is possible to miss your brain entirely, and just blow off your face
      instead.

<p><a name="silly"><b> Enlist (silly)</b></a><br>
   Time:      Jan 15 '91 or other conflict<br>
   Available: Just pop down to the local army office & sign on as a squaddie<br>
   Certainty: Be a "hero". Life expectancy in a battle is 20 minutes<br>
   Notes:     I don't think this is an entirely serious suggestion,
      particularly since only 10% ever see the front line, and only
      a few of those ever see combat.
<p>
   Calle: You could always get employed as a mercenary. That way
	  you'll at least see combat, improving your chances to die
	  vastly. Still, a silly method.

<p><a name="pencils"><b> Pencils up your nose, bang down onto table (urban legend?)</b></a><br>
   Time:      Seconds or never<br>
   Available: All you need is a couple of sharp pencils and a table<br>
   Certainty: Very uncertain<br>
   Notes:     This is a myth, I think, since the pencils would go into your
      frontal lobes, which are basically optional. This is the
      legendary "exam suicide". Fine if you want a DIY frontal-
      lobotomy rather than death!
<p>
   Calle: This is an urban legend, see the alt.folklore.urban FAQ for
	  more details. 

<p><a name="murder"><b> Getting someone to murder you</b></a><br>
   Time:      Depends on method used<br>
   Available: Know any murderous psychopaths? No, not the tax people...<br>
   Certainty: Depends on method used, & dedication of murderer<br>
   Notes:     Forget it. Unless you contract someone to do it, the chances
      are that you are going to wake up in hospital without your
      wallet. If you do contract someone, how are you going to pay
      them? Can't take them to court for running off with your
      money and not doing the job.

<p><a name="hbomb"><b> Make yourself into an h-bomb (another silly one)</b></a><br>
   Time:      Speed of light over 1/2 metre (couple of nanoseconds)<br>
   Available: Nuke (fission OR fusion), 10 litres of heavy water<br>
   Certainty: 100%<br>
   Notes:     Drink the heavy water for several days, strap yourself to
      the nuke, and press the button. If you retained a couple of
      litres of the heavy water, the additional yield should be
      6 megajoules (give or take a few orders of magnitude). Note
      that heavy water is a poison, so you might not survive that
      long anyway.
<p>
   Calle: If I remember my physics correctly, there will be no reaction
	  in your body no matter how much heavy water you have
	  ingested. Not that it matters if you're sitting on an
	  exploding hydrogen bomb!

<p><a name="nanotech"><b> Micromachines/nanocomputers (science fiction)</b></a><br>
   Time:      years or a fraction of a second - depends how you look at it<br>
   Available: in 50 -> 1000 years time?<br>
   Certainty: Good assuming that the technology is developed<br>
   Notes:     Basically, this involves a 'replicator' panel. You program it
      to replicate yourself, simplifying very slightly, with the
      exception of the urge to use this technique. After a while, you
      turn into a mindless zombie, trudging around from the exit of
      the machine to the entrance, for eternity. Strange philosophical
      implications.
<p>
   Calle: If you postulate nanomachines, why not use the deconstructor
	  kind? Take your body apart into its component molecules in
	  less than a minute... A silly method, if you hadn't guessed.

<p><a name="scuba"><b> Scuba-diving (various fatal 'accidents')</b></a><br>
   Time:      see notes -most are minutes/hours<br>
   Available: scuba diving gear, nobody around<br>
   Certainty: see notes<br>
   Notes:     The first method is to rise 30 metres or so without releasing
      your breath. Assuming that you can do it, it should cause your
      lungs to burst. The second is the bends - stay under long enough
      for the nitrogen to dissolve (30 metres for 30 minutes). go up
      rapidly without decompression time. This is unreliable, and
      may cause brain / joint damage. The third way is Carbon Monoxide
      poisoning - fill your tank with it, and stay away from other
      divers. You will fall asleep fairly quickly. See CO in poisons
      section. The final way is oxygen poisoning - however, this means
      that you have to go very deep with an oxygen-rich mix, and
      there are problems associated with that. The advantage of these
      methods is that insurance companies / relatives will assume that
      it was an accident ('misadventure'), with the possible exception
      of the CO poisoning.<p>
      The source of this follows: (from the net)
      "Rising 30m without exhaling will usually result in an over
      pressured lung, possible subcuteaneous emphazema, collapsed
      lung, death usually from drowning in your own blood. Rather
      painful and usually curable if you are rescued, but fair chance
      of dying if you aren't.<p>
      Building up a high residual nitrogen time (say 30m for 30 min)
      then coming up without decompressing will get you bent fairly
      nicely. You don't feel much, but your joints tend to start
      stiffening up after half an hour. Death is very uncertain,
      coming from a stroke. Brain damage, joint damage etc are most
      likely. Pobably can be recued but some damage certain.
      Oxygen poisoning, going down 50+m until the partial pressure of
      the oxygen reaches a toxic level. Difficult to accomplish, very
      painful to get down that deep, cold pressure etc, possibility
      of nitrogen narcosis and forgetting what you are doing. Probably
      get bent, good chance of rescue.<p>
      CO poisoning, mix a healthy batch of carbon monoxide in your
      tank as you dive, you tend to go to sleep under water, when
      combined with the above methods you have a pretty good winner,
      don't forget to forget your BCD."

   Available: You'd need a Puma (TM) robot, & some other bits<br>
   Certainty: certain, given proper programming<br>
   Notes:     You would need an industrial robot to do this properly. Give
      it a saw attachment, a sucking tube attachment, and program
      it. Make a head restraint. When you are fixed securely into
      the restraint, start the robot's program. It will drill a hole
      in your head, and stick the tube into the hole. Program it to
      wiggle the tube back and forth so that it doesn't miss anything.
      This might work better if you put a stream of water into the
      hole as well, so that the sucking attachment doesn't just suck
      air all the time. Debugging the program could be amusing.

<p><a name="microwaves"><b> Microwaves</b></a><br>
   Time:      ?<br>
   Available: Source of strong microwave emissions<br>
   Certainty: ?<br>
   Notes:     Cooking yourself. Point is to raise your core body temperature
      to fatal levels.
<p>
   Calle: Does anyone have any information on this? All that I know is
	  that standing in front of a Swedish coast surveillance radar
	  (which happens to use exactly the same wavelength as your
	  average microwave oven) is a Bad Thing. 

<p><a name="dehydration"><b> Dehydration</b></a><br>
   Time:      a week or so?<br>
   Available: you need to be able to stop medical help.<br>
   Certainty: certain if your will-power stands up to it.<br>
   Notes:     Don't eat or drink. Remember that food contains a high
      proportion of water. Avoiding medical help can be difficult.
      See 'starving to death'.

<p><a name="skydiving"><b> Skydiving 'accident'</b></a><br>
   Time:      pretty damn quick.<br>
   Available: need to join a skydiving club. Takes much time and money.<br>
   Certainty: Fairly certain. People have fallen from extreme heights
	      and survived. The resulting injuries are not fun.<br>
   Notes:     Join a skydiving club, continue to practise it for a while to
      clear off all suspicions and then once pack your parachute in
      a real mess (preferably knotted up, but not too clearly) and
      then jump. The para will not open and you will reach a terminal
      velocity of 220 km/h (160 mph/120 kn). Death is instant in the
      impact with the Planet Earth.<p>
      This has the advantages of being 'accidental', and your family/
      friends do not have the additional pain and guilt associated
      with suicides.
<p>
   Calle: In addition to the above, you need to remove or disable your
	  reserve parachute (which is not easy, I'm told). There are
	  better "accidental" methods than this.
	<p>  
	  A correspondent who is a skydiver dislikes this entry, since
	  if people use it it will give skydiving an undeservedly bad
	  reputation. 

<p><a name="silly"><b> Death by a thousand cuts; modern version (silly)</b></a><br>
   Time:      variable<br>
   Available: a heck of a lot of razor-wire.. maybe a high-voltage supply<br>
   Certainty: not very good<br>
   Notes:     This is a modern variant of the Arabic 'Death of a thousand
      cuts'. Basically, jump onto a stack of unravelled razor wire,
      and roll around till you die.. it may help to connect a high-
      voltage, low current power supply to the wire, so that you have
      spasms, which should keep you getting cut even when you are
      unconscious. Also, you should make sure that you can't roll off
      the wire.

<p><a name="crushing"><b> Crushing</b></a><br>
   Time:      seconds to minutes, depends on car press<br>
   Available: a car press.. any good junkyard<br>
   Certainty: certain as long as you can't escape<br>
   Notes:     This is an elegantly simple one.. get into a car, in a car
      press, and shortly afterwards be squashed to death as your
      body is converted into a red pulp. It may be tricky getting
      the press to trigger, but if you hide in the car someone
      may come along and activate it. There are other ways of
      getting crushed, this just happens to be the most effective
      I can think up on the spur of the moment. Getting yourself
      run over by a fully loaded articulated lorry is quite good.
      You should remember that people quite often survive the actual
      crushing; they die when the weight is taken OFF them.

<p><a name="wwiii"><b> World War Three</b></a><br>
   Time:      moments if you are near a militarilly significant site<br>
   Available: happen to be one of the 'key-holders'? president maybe?<br>
   Certainty: pretty certain<br>
   Notes:     All you have to do is trigger world war three. Fire an ICBM
      or three at the Chinese and the Russians... This method has
      the advantage that you take everyone else with you! Trouble
      is, the number of people with the requisite access is minimal,
      and I sort of doubt that any readers of ASH can do this.
<p>
   Calle: Lots harder since the collapse of the Soviet Union... Silly.

<p><a name="heatstroke"><b> Heatstroke</b></a><br>
   Time:      4 hours or more<br>
   Available: Very hot day; no disturbance from neighbours etc<br>
   Certainty: depends on the weather<br>
   Notes:     Basically, the point is to give yourself extreme heatstroke.
      You should pass out after a few hours. Use some aluminium foil
      to direct the sun's heat onto you, to speed up the process
      a bit. Try to reduce the chance of being interuppted, take off
      the phone etc. Obviously, start in the morning! Helps if the
      outside temperature is >100F.

<p><a name="acid"><b> Acid bath</b></a><br>
   Time:      depends on acid<br>
   Available: a lot of a very strong acid<br>
   Certainty: fairly good<br>
   Notes:     [from alt.suicide.holiday]<br>
      "summer heat got you down? Try the new and improved neighbourhood
      acid bath. Most metal working plants and some auto-repair shops
      will have a nice soothing acid bath. This, of course, is for
      those of you who enjoy extreme pain and don't want to make a
      mess for others to clean up. If you don't leave a note chances
      are they will never know what happened, aside from the shop /
      plant being broken into."

<p><a name="carbomb"><b> Fake car bomb</b></a><br>
   Time:      milliseconds<br>
   Available: explosive<br>
   Certainty: fairly good if enough explosive<br>
   Notes:     This is a modification of the basic use-explosives method. What
      you do, is make a homemade car bomb, and drive off happily after
      chatting with your neighbour about how well your life is going,
      apart from a few minor death-threats from an Iraqi death-squad..
      To confuse the authorities even more, have a note in your pocket
      listing the telephone numbers of all the eastern foreign
      embassies in your pocket, together with a little line of random
      "code numbers" next to each.., and a random but large amount of
      cash listed against each code number. :-) Oh yes, and a heavily
      annotated copy of Jane's Defence Weekly - Xhosa edition.

<p><a name="jumpbridge"><b> Jumping off bridges (slice and dice with piano wire)</b></a><br>
   Time:      9.87 ms-2; 4 to 10 meters; calculate it yourself!<br>
   Available: Rope, pianowire and a high bridge.<br>
   Certainty: Fairly certain<br>
   Notes:     Never been tried. Can also be used with a fairly
      high building, but then the art-motive will
      disappear.<p>
      Cut the rope and wire in various lengths. Each
      length must not be longer than the height of the
      bridge.<p>
      Tie one end of the ropes and wires to the bridge
      Tie the other part of the ropes to different bodyparts
      like thigh, calves, torso etc.  Then tie the
      pianowires around your joints. (Don't forget your
      genitals..)<p>
      When you jump various parts of you body are whipped
      away by the pianowire nooses, and your bits are held
      up by the ropes swaying in the breeze.
      If you to this right you should end up with just your
      torso hanging by it's neck above the sea, highway,
      ground.<p>
      Do it with friends, and call it art.

<p><a name="eaten"><b> Being eaten alive</b></a><br>
   Time:      depends, but probably a couple of minutes<br>
   Available: zoo, or live in Africa/wherever<br>
   Certainty: not brilliant.. what if they're not hungry and don't finish?<br>
   Notes:     basically, find one or more hungry carnivores... tigers
      are nice. Also, sharks, lions, any of the big cats..

<p><a name="reentry"><b> Being burned up in unprotected re-entry (silly)</b></a><br>
   Time:      probably a few minutes<br>
   Available: if you happen to be able to get into orbit<br>
   Certainty: about as certain as you can get!<br>
   Notes:     Just go for a spacewalk in a low earth orbit, and decelerate
      enough to enter the atmosphere. You'll get a great view...


<p><a name="aids"><b> Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)</b></a><br>
   Time:      Incubation period 1 to 10 years, death within 2 years of diagnosis
              of AIDS, Can have HIV for years/decades<br>
   Dosage:    Just one intimate contact with an Infected person of any gender<br>
   Available: Available to all for free<br>
   Certainty: 99.9% certainty AFTER infected<br>
   Notes:     [2]:<br>
      This is not painfree. This method may cost you alot of money if
      you allow others to get you medical attention. It may a little difficult
      to get infected as people who know they have it may not comply with
      your request. Could be great fun attempting to get infected depending
      upon your attitude (remember -any gender - you don't have to limit
      yourself - you're going to die, you might as well try it ;). Should be
      quite devasting to your family & close friends. You also get the
      satisfaction of leaving behind a virtual unrecognizable-as-you body !
      This also gives you the prime opportunity to point your finger at your
      dentist and say he did it for all the times you have suffered in their
      chair.  Happy dying !
<p>
   Calle: May not be so certain any more. Ten years may well be long
	  enough for someone to develop a cure. Silly, IMHO.

<p><a name="autodecapitate"><b> Auto-decapitation by car (added by Calle)</b></a><br>
   Time:      Real quick<br>
   Available: You need access to a car and a rope<br>
   Certainty: I wouldn't trust it<br>
   Notes:<br>
      Comes from alt.suicide.holiday. Basic idea is to tie one end of
      the rope around your neck, tie the other end to a real solid
      object, get into the car and accelerate away as fast as the car
      can manage. When you reach the end of the rope, your head gets
      torn off. Be sure to use enough rope and fasten your seat belt.
<p>
      A posting to a.s.h. in July 1993 says that someone in Washinton
      State, USA actually used this method to commit suicide, so it
      can't be that bad. The posting said that 25 feet of rope were
      used (about 7.5 meters), which does sound a bit short. Perhaps
      he had a real awesome car.

<p><a name="bodypaint"><b> Death by painting your body (very silly, and wrong)</b></a><br>
   Dosage : Less than 1 can of paint depending on your body type<br>
   Time   : ? Probably less than 8 hours<br>
   Availability : Very available ! You have a choice of greasepaint or
      House paint. You need a type of paint that will not allow your
      pores to breath in order to be successful at this. You also have 
      a smashing selection of colors you can choose to die in ! Nile
      Green ? Blood Red ? Basic Black ? Or any combo you desire.. If
      you couldn't decide before what to wear to die in, this method
      will cause you considerable angst. <br>
   Certainty : This is a sure method, provided you have a paint that
      will block your pores from breathing. Don't forget the bottom of
      your feet. You must paint every last bit of available skin. If
      your pores can breathe, you won't die. <br>
   Notes : I read this in some theater journal 5 or so years ago,
      saying when you you do full body makeup, you must insure that
      parts of the body are left naked to breathe or the actor will
      die. Usually for full body makeup, they leave the bottoms of
      feet, and some patterns on the body, like lines so the actor
      doesn't suffocate.
<p>
   Calle: This is an *extremely* silly one. It was in the "not yet
      edited" portion of Mike's file, and I think it is quite straight
      from an a.s.h. posting.
      This method does not work. As you can check in most any book on
      human anatomy, the skin does not breathe. The only places in
      your body which absorbs oxygen are the lungs and the corneas,
      and the corneas only feed themselves. 
      You might get ill or even die if you use poisonous paint, though.
