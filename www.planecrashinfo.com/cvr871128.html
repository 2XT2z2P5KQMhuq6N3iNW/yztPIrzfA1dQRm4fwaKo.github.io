<b>The plane took off from Taiwan on a flight to South Africa. While over the 
Indian Ocean, the crew reported a fire on one of the six cargo pallets in the 
main air-freight hold. On the CVR , the captain is heard informing the crew that 
there were explosives in the cargo hold and possibly a nuclear device. The 
captain had refused to take off, but finally agreed when threatened with 
dismissal if he didn't make the fight. The fire caused incapacitation and 
disorientation of the crew, in-flight break-up and loss of control of the 
aircraft. The plane crashed into the Indian Ocean 220 kms NE of Mauritius.
