<span class="style4"><strong class="x"><span class="style2"><span class="style3">The Airbus went missing over the Atlantic Ocean on a flight from Rio de Janeiro,  Brazil to Paris, France. <br>
The last radio contact with the flight was at 01:33 UTC.  The aircraft left CINDACTA III radar coverage at <br>
01:48 UTC, flying normally at FL350. The aircraft reportedly went through a thunderstorm with strong<br>
turbulence at 02:00 UTC. At 02:14 UTC an automated message was received indicating a failure of the<br>
electrical system. The plane carried 12 crew members and 216 passengers. The wreckage was finally<br>
discovered on April 3, 2011 using unmanned submarines.  Flight447 passed into clouds associated with<br>
a large system of thunderstorms, its speed sensors became iced over, and the autopilot disengaged.<br>
In the ensuing confusion, the pilots lost control of the airplane because they reacted incorrectly to the<br>
loss of instrumentation and then seemed unable to comprehend the nature of the problems they had <br>
caused.</span></span></strong>

When a plane is  taking off or aborting a landing&mdash;&quot;going around&quot;&mdash;it must gain both  speed and altitude as efficiently as possible. At this critical phase of  flight, pilots are trained to increase engine speed to the TOGA level and raise  the nose to a certain pitch angle.&nbsp; Clearly, here Bonin  is trying to achieve the same effect: He wants to increase speed and to climb  away from danger. But he is not at sea level; he is in the far thinner air of  37,500 feet. The engines generate less thrust here, and the wings generate less  lift. Raising the nose to a certain angle of pitch does not result in the same  angle of climb, but far less. Indeed, it can&mdash;and will&mdash;result in a descent.]&nbsp;<br>

The vertical speed toward the ocean accelerates.  If Bonin were to let go of the controls, the nose would fall and the plane  would regain forward speed. But because he is holding the stick all the way  back, the nose remains high and the plane has barely enough forward speed for  the controls to be effective.

At any rate, without warning his colleagues, Bonin once again takes back the  controls and pulls his side stick all the way back.]&nbsp;<br>
