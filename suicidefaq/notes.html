   At the end of Mike's file there were an entry for Nitrous Oxide. I
   have removed it, as there already is one. There were also a mail
   were someone recommended military nerve toxins. They might not be
   as certain as the originator thought, as current military thinking
   is that one griveously wounded man is worth many dead ones in
   decreasing the enemy's fighting capacity. That means that modern
   nerve gasses well might leave you paralyzed for life, but still
   living. Anyway, if you can get military stuff, why not use a rifle
   or a few kilos of explosive?
