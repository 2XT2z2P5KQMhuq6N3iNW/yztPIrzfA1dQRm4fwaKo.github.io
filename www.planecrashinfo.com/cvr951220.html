<b>While on a flight from Miami, FL to Cali, Columbia the aircraft crashed into 
Mt. El Deluvio 38 miles north of Cali while attempting to land. On approach, the 
crew were requested to report over Tulua VOR which they already passed. This 
confused them and they decided to go direct to Rozo beacon. Entering the 
abbreviation &quot;R&quot;, incorrectly steered the plane towards Bogota. More than a 
minute into the turn the crew steered manually toward Cali, but this now took 
them into the path of a mountain. Crew error. Lack of situational awareness, 
failure to adequately plan and execute the approach, failure to realize that the 
FMS had turned the aircraft toward mountains. Crew also neglected to retract the 
speed brakes after the ground proximity warning system alert. Lack of adequate 
radar. Different Flight Management System naming convention from that published 
in navigational charts. One-hundred-sixty out of 164 aboard killed.</b></p>
<p>2125:40&nbsp; First Officer: Well let's see, we got a hundred and thirty six 
miles to the VOR, and thirty two thousand feet to lose, and slow down to boot so 
we might as well get started. </p>
<p>2125:49 Captain: Alright sir. </p>
<p>2126:01 Captain: And if if you'd keep the speed up in the descent, I'd, it 
would help us too, OK? </p>
<p>2126:04 First Officer: OK. </p>
<p>2126:16 Captain (radio): Bogota, American nine six five request descent. </p>
<p>2126:20 Bogota Center: American nine six five, descend and maintain flight 
level two four zero, report reaching. </p>
<p>2126:26 Captain (radio): OK, we're leaving three seven zero. Descend and 
maintain two four zero, twenty four. Thank you ma'am. American nine six five.
</p>
<p><i>[Flight Level Change selected, V-NAV disengaged.]</i> </p>
<p>2126:33 Bogota Center: That's correct. </p>

five minutes from now, and go ahead the weather. </p>
<p>2127:00 AAL Cali Ops: OK sir, the the change over, the temperature is twenty
