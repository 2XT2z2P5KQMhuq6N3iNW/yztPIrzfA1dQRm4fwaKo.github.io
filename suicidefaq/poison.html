<h1> POISON</h1> <ul> <lt> [1] makes most of
these points:</lt> <li> Most drugs cause vomiting. To help stop this,
take one or two anti-
    histamine tablets (travel sickness, allergy, hayfever tablets etc) about
    an hour before, on a fairly empty stomach.</li>
<li>   If the drugs are in tablet form, take the first 20% as they are, and the
    rest crushed and dissolved / mixed in with strong alcohol / food. This
    helps the drugs to hit at the same time.</li>
<li> Alcohol helps dissolve the drugs. Don't drink any beforehand, but wash the
    tablets down with vodka or similar, and then drink afterwards while you're
    still conscious.</li>
<li>  Use a large airtight plastic bag over your head, + something around your
  neck to hold it on. This transforms a 90% certainty method into a 99%...</li>
<li> Friday night is a good time if you life alone - nobody will miss you until
    Monday if you work. Bolt all the doors you can. Say you'll be out over the
    weekend visiting someone, so people don't expect a reply to telephone.</li>
<li> Some painkillers etc have less effect if you use them normally (tolerance).</li>
<li>  In general, you need to stay away from medical help until you actually die,
    but there are exceptions to this (that have been pointed out in the text).</li>
</ul>

Common drugs:

<P><A Name="cyanide"><B>Cyanide (HCN, KCN)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    50 mg Hydrogen Cyanide gas, 200-300 mg Cyanide salts<br>
      Time:      seconds for HC, minutes Cs (empty stomach) hours (full s)<br>
      Available: very difficult to get hold of<br>
      Certainty: very certain<br>
      Notes:     It helps to have an empty stomach (since the salts react
         with the stomach acids to form H.C.). A full stomach can delay death
         for up to four hours with the salts. Antidotes to cyanide poisoning
         exist, but they have serious side effects. What you can do, is instead
         of taking the salts directly, drop 500mg or so into a strong acid,
         and inhale the fumes. This will be pure Hydrogen Cyanide, and you
         should die in 10 to 20 seconds.<br>
         [3]:<br>
         "Hydrocyanic acid is one of the most poisonous substances known; the
         inhalation of its fumes in high concentration will cause almost
         immediate death. Hydrogen cyanide acts by preventing the normal
         process of tissue oxidation and paralyzing the respiratory center in
         the brain. Most of the accidental cases are due to inhaling the fumes
         during a fumigating process. In the pure state it kills with great
         rapidity. Crystalline cyanides, such as potassium or sodium cyanide
         are equally poisonous, since they interact with the hydrochloric acid
         in the stomach to liberate hydrocyanic acid. This poison has been used
         for both homicide and suicide; in recent history, a number of European
         political figures carried vials of cyanide salt for emergency
         self-destruction and some used them. Death resulted from amounts of
         only a fraction of a gram. A concentration of 1 part in 500 of
         hydrogen cyanide gas is fatal. Allowable working concentration in most
         of the United States is 20 ppm. Two and one-half grains of liquid acid
         has killed. The acid acts fatally in about 15 minutes. The cyanide
         salts kill in several hours. The average dose of solution is 0.1 cc.
         [1, DGHS talking about KCN]:
         on an empty stomach, take a small glass of cold tap water. (Not
         mineral water nor any sort of juice or soda water because of it's
         acidity). Stir 1 -> 1.5 grammes of KCN into the water. More than that
         causes irritation to the throat. Wait 5 minutes to dissolve. It should
         be drunk within several hours. Consciousness will be lost in about a
         minute. Death will follow 15 -> 45 minutes later.


<P><A Name="aspirin"><B>Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    20-30+ grammes (too many cause vomitting)<br>
      Time:      hours to days, variable<br>
      Available: easy to get hold of (get soluble ones, & dissolve them)<br>
      Certainty: unreliable<br>
      Notes:     Not recommended, fatal dose varies wildly, could cause liver
         & kidney damage instead of death. OD causes strange noises in your
         ears (like a video arcade) & projectile vomiting after about 10 hours.
         Medical help generally effective, so stay out of hospital for a couple
         of days. May cause bleeding in your stomach/upper intestines. Take
         with sodium bicarbinate (eg, bicarb. of soda), which speeds up the
         absorption (sp?) significantly. Take 1 or 2 antihistamine tablets.

<P><A Name="paracetamol"><B>Paracetamol (Aka Acetaminopren / Tylenol)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    15+ grammes, 20+ is better<br>
      Time:      10 hours fatal damage, but 2 weeks to actually die<br>
      Available: easy to get hold of<br>
      Certainty: fairly reliable<br>
      Notes:     Once 10-12 hours is up, you've had it, but you still live for
         a week or two after that. Probably better to wait 15 hours just to
         make sure. Horrible side effects during this time (some of which are:
         acute toxic hepatitis, renal failure, cerebral oedema, intra-abdominal
         bleeding, aspiration pneumonia, haemophilia). Too small dose causes
         severe liver damage. Accidental deaths are very common. There are few
         if any side effects before the damage becomes fatal; occasionally
         vomitting and nausea.

<P><A Name="alcohol"><B>Alcohol (Spirits Preferably, Your Choice)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    1/2 litre vodka?, similar. Varies from person to person.<br>
      Time:      about 8 hours<br>
      Available: good<br>
      Certainty: unreliable<br>
      Notes:     will cause liver and kidney damage if 'rescued' before death.
         Drink it all at the same time, quickly as possible. Dosage is
         questionable, I don't have any figures. Taking the spirits as an
         enema is supposed to be a very quick way of absorbing alcohol, but a
         less unpleasant way is to inject it. The dosage it takes to kill you
         depends on whether you drink normally, the state of your liver,
         whether you pass out on your back or not.
         [3]: "The fatal dose of pure alcohol in an average adult is 300-400 mL
         (750-1000 mL of 40% alcohol) if consumed in less than one hour. Apart
         from the effects of overdosage, death after alcohol consumption can
         occur as a result of choking on vomit while unconscious. .....
         Consequences such as liver damage occur after chronic consumption."
         Alcohol helps other drugs to dissolve. Don't drink it in advance, wash
         down tablets with it, & follow by drinking another few glasses of
         spirits.

<P><A Name="water"><B>Water</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    14 litres mentioned<br>
      Time:      12 hours or so?<br>
      Available: always available<br>
      Certainty: unknown<br>
      Notes:     works by washing out the salts in your body, until the cells
         fail (osmotic balance buggered up). You need to keep drinking
         continually until you collapse. Unusual method. Someone suggested it
         would also cause cramps. The following is something from [2]:
         "About a year ago a local newspaper carried a story about a
         woman who had drunk herself to death. Apparently she had ingested
         something mildly poisonous, and when she called her doctor asking him
         what to do, he told her to drink lots of water and see him in the
         morning. She got to it and managed to drink no less than 14 litres of
         water before the osmotic balance in her body was so upset it could no
         longer function and she died (don't know how quickly)".
<p>
<i>	 Calle: The above anecdote originally came from me, and the
		death described occured in Växjö, Sweden.
		Unfortunately I no longer remember which newspaper I
		saw it in.
<p>
		Recently, I was told about a similar case in San
		Antonio. It supposedly happened a couple of years ago
		and was reported in the local San Antonio Express/News.

<P><A Name="bleach"><B>Bleach And Other Corrosives (Lye, Drain Cleaning Fluids)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    A bottle (litre or half litre)<br>
      Time:      Hours/days<br>
      Available: Easily available<br>
      Certainty: Uncertain<br>
      Notes:     Bloody painful - depends on your stomach getting corroded,
         the stomach acids escaping, and doing their dirty work in your vital
         organs.
         [1] says: "I have heard of people throwing themselves through plate
         glass windows in their death agonies after drinking lye."

<P><A Name="insulin"><B>Insulin (Injected)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    No idea<br>
      Time:      death in hours to days<br>
      Available: Difficult to get hold of unless you're a diabetic or a vet<br>
      Certainty: reasonable<br>
      Notes:     Supposed to be quite pleasant (eg insulin shock treatments
         used for some psychiatric condition).

<P><A Name="petrol"><B>Petrol (In Lungs/Injected)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    "A Thimble-full" -20 ml?<br>
      Time:      Seconds/minutes<br>
      Available: Common<br>
      Certainty: I'm not sure of the dosage, but fairly certain if correct<br>
      Notes:     Can also use LPG (propane/butane) on skin surface (since
         these are light enough to go through the skin). Stick your hand in a
         bucket of propane and see how many seconds you last...

<P><A Name="wintergreen"><B>Oil Of Wintergreen/Methyl Salicylate (In Lungs/Injected)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    Probably similar to petrol (20 ml)<br>
      Time:      Don't know<br>
      Available: Not available in concentration<br>
      Certainty: Don't know<br>
      Notes:     Don't have enough information on this one to be able to say
         anything about it. If it is just taken normally, it is the same as
         aspirin.

<P><A Name="malathion"><B>Malathion (Insecticide)</b> (Entry Revised By Calle)</A><br>
      Dosage:    A few bottles, at least<br>
      Time:      2 to 3 hours<br>
      Available: From a large garden centre or DIY shop<br>
      Certainty: not so good<br>
      Notes:     A correspondent mentions that the LD50 of this stuff
		 is 1 g/kg in rats, and adds that there is not nearly
		 that much in a bottle. He also mentions that it is
		 treatable. Instead of this, he recommends parathion,
		 if you really want to use an insecticide.

<P><A Name="phosphine"><B>Phosphine Gas From Aluminium Phosphide Pesticide (ALP)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    Single 3 gramme tablet (".. is enough to kill 10 people")<br>
      Time:      About 2 hours<br>
      Available: Difficult. Used in India, sold on black market.<br>
      Certainty: Without medical help, and using fresh pill, very good<br>
      Notes:     This is a common way of committing suicide in Indian villages.
         There is no specific antidote to this. The pills are 3 grammes of ALP,
         which produces lethal phosphine gas when it comes in contact with
         hydrochloric acid or water in the stomach. After severe vomiting, the
         victim loses consciousness, the blood vessels rupture, and body
         cavities fill with blood. While the pill is exceedingly lethal, some
         escape death because the rate of the gas' release declines with the
         pill's age and use, and exposure to moisture.  Trouble with this one
         is the availability, and it also looks like a rather unpleasant.

<P><A Name="ratpoisin"><B>Rat Poison (Warfarin)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    not known<br>
      Time:      Hours to terminal damage, days to actual death<br>
      Available: Available<br>
      Certainty: Certain given suffient dosage. Most probably treatable.<br>
      Notes:     This is one of the truly unpleasant poisons, along with
         Paracetamol/Acetylminopren. I think it causes cerebral haemorage (rat
         poison works by giving the unfortunate rat haemophillia). Doctors
         can't do anything about it, they just leave you to die in agony on an
         intensive care ward.
<i>
      Calle: Since human haemophiliacs usually live quite ordinary
	     lives, the above sounds rather improbable.

<P><A Name="caffeine"><B>Caffeine</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    20 grammes (someone said 8 -> 10 grammes)<br>
      Time:      not known<br>
      Available: Caffeine tablets available in Chemist shops<br>
      Certainty: don't know<br>
      Notes:     I don't know very much about this.  There isn't all that much
         caffeine in coffee, maybe 200 mg.

<P><A Name="KCl"><B>Potassium Chloride</B> (Injected In Solution)</A><br>
      Dosage:    not known (try 20cc injection of strong solution)<br>
      Time:      Seconds to minutes<br>
      Available: Widely available<br>
      Certainty: Certain given correct dosage<br>
      Notes:     Causes heart attack (which is painful). May be difficult
         for coroner to realise it was suicide rather than a natural heart
         attack. An excess of K+ in the blood interferes with nerve signals,
         and stops muscles and nerves from working. So when it reaches your
         heart, the heart stops.

<P><A Name="Nitrogen"><B>Nitrogen Gas (Or Other Inert Gas)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    Several litres uncompressed is minimum<br>
      Time:      Minutes<br>
      Available: Try plumber, or welding supplies company<br>
      Certainty: Certain<br>
      Notes:     This is really a form of asphyxiation, (see later), but is
         particularly good since you don't experience the lack of oxygen (what
         people really experience is the EXCESS of carbon dioxide).

<P><A Name="NO2"><B>Nitrous Oxide</B> (N20? NO2?)</A><i>(NO2 /Ingvar)</i><br>
      Dosage:    Unknown<br>
      Time:      Minutes<br>
      Available: Dentists supply would be good<br>
      Certainty: reasonable<br>
      Notes:     Asphyxiate yourself with laughing gas. Nice.

<P><A Name="co"><B>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    5% concentration or so?<br>
      Time:      Minutes to hours depending on concentration<br>
      Available: You get it out of a car exhaust, you used to be able to use
         "town gas" (eg, stick your head in the cooker) but this is no longer
         available<br>
      Certainty: Fairly certain, as long as you aren't "rescued"<br>
      Notes:     Causes brain damage.<p>
<i>
      Calle: A correspondent from Denmark, where you still can use
	     "town gas" to kill yourself, says that even though it's
	     possible it's not a good idea. He tells of an incident
	     where a family committed suicide by turning on the gas
	     and waiting. Apparently, the heavier-than-air carbon
	     monoxide leaked through the floor and reached the people
	     in the apartment below. Not nice.
<p>
	     The actual cause of death is asphyxiation, since the
	     carbon monoxide binds tighter to haemoglobine than oxygen
	     does (the oxygen gets crowded out, so to speak).
</i>
<P><A Name="Cl2"><B>Chlorine Gas</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    not known<br>
      Time:      not known<br>
      Available: tricky<br>
      Certainty: Good<br>
      Notes:     This was used in the first world war in the trenches.
         Probably very unpleasant, does something to the lungs.

<P><A Name="hydrazine"><B>Hydrazine</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    As produced by reaction<br>
      Time:      Not known, fortnight?<br>
      Available: Bottle of bleach & bottle of ammonia<br>
      Certainty: not known<br>
      Notes:     [2]:<br>
         "This is no joke, D----.  Several years ago at my high school, one of
         the janitors innocently mixed together half a bottle of bleach with
         half a bottle of of ammonia in a small closet where the cleaning
         fluids were kept. He passed out due to the hydrazine (not chlorine)
         gas released in the reaction between the two chemicals. This man was
         in agony for two weeks in an intensive care unit in a local hospital
         with the majority of the inside surface of his lungs damaged and
         untreatable before he got lucky and died."

<P><A Name="chloroform"><B>Chloroform</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    not known, just put a splash onto a rag<br>
      Time:      several minutes probably<br>
      Available: not known<br>
      Certainty: good<br>
      Notes:     If you tape the rag over your mouth so that you get knocked
         out, you should die as you continue getting the stuff into your lungs.

<P><A Name="digitalis"><B>Digitalis (Foxglove, Digitalis Purpurea)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    not known<br>
      Time:      not known<br>
      Available: extract from foxgloves<br>
      Certainty: bad due to vomiting<br>
      Notes:     [4]:<br>
         Gives you a heart-attack. Symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
         diarrhoea, headache, and slow irregular pulse. Also sometimes
         trembling, convulsions, delirium, and hallucinations. Its difficult to
         take a fatal amount because vomiting usually gets rid of it.

<P><A Name="yew"><B>Yew (Taxus Baccata, The "English Yew")</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    not known<br>
      Time:      Can be very rapid (minutes), occasionally 3 or 4 days.<br>
      Available: Grows wild in the UK, don't know about elsewhere.<br>
      Certainty: not sure, but it sounds good if you eat enough<br>
      Notes:     [4]:<br>
         All parts of the plant, _except_ for the fleshy red bit of the fruit,
         contain poisons. The seeds are poisonous, so if you eat the berries,
         chew them. Symptoms: nausea, abdominal pain, coma, death. The mode of
         death is a heart attack which occurs rapidly after eating sufficient.
         If no heart attack occurs, you'll probably survive. Sometimes the
         sudden collapse leading to death is preceded by lethargy, trembling,
         staggering, coldness, dilation of the pupils, rapid pulse that becomes
         weak, and convulsions. Other species in this genus are said to be
         equally poisonous. See <a href="poison.html#plants">"plants in general"</a>.

<P><A Name="mezerin"><B>Mezerein, Daphnetoxin (Mezereon, AKA Daphne Mezereum, AKA D. Laureola)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    "a few". Probably 10 or more.<br>
      Time:      not known<br>
      Available: Garden plant. Seeds are particularly poisonous.<br>
      Certainty: not known, dosage is questionable.<br>
      Notes:     [4]:<br>
         The berries taste horrid, but you only need to eat a few to cause
         death. Symptoms: burning sensation in mouth, nausea, vomiting, stomach
         pains, diarrhoea, weakness, disorientation, convulsions, followed by
         death. The seeds can be dried and stored without affecting the
         poisons. Don't confuse this with laurels in the Prunus genus, Rosacea
         family. See "plants in general".

<P><A Name="atropine"><B>Atropine (Atropa Belladonna AKA Deadly Nightshade. Also Potato Fruits)</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    5 berries in young children.. maybe 30 in adults?<br>
      Time:      6 to 24 hours<br>
      Available: from fruits of some plants in the potato family.<br>
      Certainty: unknown, particularly dosage is questionable<br>
      Notes:     [4]:<br>
         AB also contains hyoscyamine and hyoscine (scopolamine). Symptoms:
         dry mouth, flushed face, dilation of pupils, rapid pulse. Possibly
         also breathing difficulties, constipation, convulsions,
         hallucinations, and coma. AB is often confused with other Nightshade
         species, which aren't as poisonous. The berries are black in AB, and
         red in Woody Nightshade. In addition, the flowers are larger (1.2 in)
         in the true Deadly Nightshade.
         Present in unripe deadly nightshake fruits, fruits of potato, and
         fruits of other members of this family (not tomato though!), but stick
         with AB. See the "plants in general" entry.

      Dosage:    not known, but fairly small amounts.<br>
      Time:      unknown.<br>
      Available: leaves, wood of the plant. From garden centres.<br>
      Certainty: unknown.<br>
      Notes:     [4]:<br>
         Deaths have been caused by using wood from this plant in fires, and
         making tea from the leaves. In a few hours there is abdominal pain,
         nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhoea, rapid pulse, and visual effects.
         Later, a slow, weak, irregular pulse and fall in blood pressure,

      Certainty: Definite without med. treatment; unknown with.<br>
      Notes:     [5, Volume 7, pp591-592]:<br>
         "Poisoning by toxic Amanita species is characterised by a delay in
         onset of 4 to 12 hours. At this point, nausea vomiting, colic-like
         pain, and diarrhea occur. There then follows a period of respite,
         which can last for two to four days. This phase does NOT signify
         recovery: damage to the liver and kidneys continues to develop and
         the respite gives way to hepatic and renal failure. Death usually
         occurs a week or so after poisoning.". See "plants in general".

<P><A Name="ricin"><B>Ricin (Castor Oil Plant, Ricinus Communis)</B></A><br>

      Time:      within 3 to 5 days<br>
      Available: From eating the castor beans<br>
      Certainty: depends on ricin content of the beans. Pure ricin is deadly<br>
      Notes:     [2] and [4]:<br>
         Symptoms begin within a few hours with abdominal pain, vomiting and
         bloody diarrhoea for several days. Decreased production of urine and
         a fall in blood pressure. Note that people have survived eating more
         than 10 beans, *with treatment*. Presumably the fatal dose without
         medical intervention is less. Surviving more than 3 to 5 days usually
         means recovery. Ricin is described as "..one of the most potent toxins
         known".<p>
         In 1978 a Bulgarian journalist (Georgi Markov) was assassinated in
         London by being prodded with an umbrella. The umbrella had a tiny ball
         coated with ricin on its tip, which lodged into the dissident. He

      Time:      symptoms in about 4 hours, death in about 4 days<br>
      Available: Easily available (from large garden centre)<br>
      Certainty: certain<br>
      Notes:     [New Scientist article:]<br>
         From the Autumn crocus (Colchicum Autumnale) / royal lily (Gloriosa
         Superba). One flower of CA is about 12 mg, so take at least five of
         them. 20g tuber of GS provides 60mg, single seed of CA provides 3.5mg
         (so take 18). Damages blood vessels and nerves, and stops cell
         division. Don't know whether its painful or not, but that bit about
         damaging nerves is worrying. I just _love_ the name of the acid! See

      Available: Garden plant, so get from garden centre<br>
      Certainty: unknown (can be treated in hospital)<br>
      Notes:     [2] and [4]:<br>
         The poison is concentrated in the unripe seed pods and roots.
         During winter, the roots are particularly poisonous. Symptoms develop
         in less than an hour. Burning sensation, feelings of coldness,
         sweating. Later, numbness, vomiting and diarrhoea with abdominal pain.
         Finally, slow pulse, convulsions and coma. Death may occur within 2
         hours. The poison kills by causing a cardiac failure, and it is
         painful. See the "plants in general" comment.

      Certainty: good, but resembles wild carrot & wild parsnip.<br>
      Notes:     [4]:<br>
         The poison is strongest in the yellow juice of the underground parts.
         Symptoms after half an hour: burning of mouth, excessive saliva,
         flushing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, dilation of pupils, and later a
         bluish tinge to the skin. Muscular contractions and convulsions, with
         difficulties in breathing are followed by unconsciousness and death,

      Available: Grows throughout UK, except north. Don't know about elsewhere.<br>
      Certainty: unknown<br>
      Notes:     [4]:<br>
         <b>NOTE</b>: There are many plants called "hemlock", some of which aren't
         poisonous at all. It can also be mistaken for wild parsley and carrot,
         and is in the same family as Cowbane.
         Symptoms appear in 15 mins to 2 hours. Initially burning and dryness
         of the mouth, muscular weakness leading to paralysis that affects the
         breathing. Sometimes also dilation of pupils, vomiting, diarrhoea,
         convulsions, and loss of consciousness. If this is survived, birth
         defects may be caused in pregnant women.
         This is said to be the plant that Socrates took in 399 BC.

      Certainty: Fairly good, if you get the right species.<br>
      Notes:     [4]:<br>
         The tubers contain more poison than the rest of the plant,
         particularly in winter and early spring, and may be cooked or dried.
         Symptoms within an hour or two, nausea, salivation, vomiting,
         diarrhoea, sweating, weakness of legs, dilation of pupils. Later loss
         of consciousness with convulsions before death. See <a href="#plants">"plants in

         consider poisonous plants as a means of exit far too unreliable and
         painful. No matter how desperate you are, don't even think about it!"

<P><A Name=""><B>Nicotine</b> <i>(Rewritten By Calle)</i></A><br>
      Dosage:    extract from 100g tabacco? 40-60 mg pure.<br>
      Time:      Several hours, coma may set in much earlier. Much
		 quicker if taken in large doses.<br>
      Available: Easily available<br>
      Certainty: Fairly certain, given a large enough dose.<br>
      Notes:     <br>
         This is what Mike wrote:
<p>
	 "Soak 100 grammes of tabacco for a few days. You get a brown
         mess. Strain off the tabacco, then simmer slowly until most of the
         liquid has gone, leaving about 2 teaspoons of brown treacle-like
         stuff. Add it to your night-time drink, and never wake up. Someone
         said the other day that 150mg of pure nicotine would be fatal in
         seconds. See the <a href="poison.html#plants">"plants in general"</a> entry."
<p> 
	 It is correct, as far as I have found out. It can be added
	 that the effects include violent convulsions and that the
	 direct cause of death is respiratory failure. Smokers should
	 use larger doses than non-smokers.

      Available: diet, health food shops<br>
      Certainty: good<br>
      Notes:     [2]:<br>
         "Well it seems that iron pills achieve death. They oxydize in the
         stomach and eat a hole in it. The only reason I know this is that
         someone at my school just recently OD'd and died from this. It was
         ruled suicide since no person could accidently take that many iron
         pills. They didn't say how many she took or how many it takes to kill
         yourself though." [sounds unpleasant]

      Time:      2 to 3 hours?<br>
      Available: Difficult<br>
      Certainty: not known<br>
      Notes:     Read something in a newspaper... a coke dealer died after
         eating an ounce of it, when the police raided his house. Cause of
         death was a cardiac arrest 2 1/2 hours after the overdose. However, a
         cocaine OD is painful, and causes paranoia / breathing problems. One
         form of cocaine smuggling is to swallow condoms filled with the stuff.
         From time to time, a "mule" has a condom burst inside him, and dies in
         pain reasonably quickly.

<P><A Name="lsd"><B>LSD</b> (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide) <b>Nonfatal</B></A><br>
      Dosage:    infinite!<br>
      Time:      never<br>
      Available: who cares?<br>
      Certainty: will not kill you<br>
      Notes:     LSD can't kill you by overdose.. you might go psychotic if you
         take tens/hundreds of thousands of times the normal dose, but thats
         hardly surprising, since you'd have to be insane to take that much in
         the first place. General warning - even for normal use, if you are
         depressed, it'll just amplify the depression, not lift it, and the
         chances of a bad trip are probably higher. Probably, the only way to
         kill yourself with this stuff is to drop two tonnes of it on yourself.
<p>
<i>      Calle: I don't quite believe in what Mike is saying about
	     psychosis here. As far as I have been able to find out,
	     LSD works by catalyzing certain substances in the brain,
	     and thus vast overdoses have no more effect than merely
	     large ones. Once all the stuff in your brain is used up,
	     there will be no more effect.
<p>
	     A correspondent points out a case reported by The Journal
	     of Clinical Toxicology where eight people snorted pure
	     LSD Tartrate, beliving that it was cocaine. The amounts
	     ingested was estimated to be from 1000 to 10000 times an
	     ordinary dose. Half of them lapsed into comas, but all of
	     them came out of it without any treatment. Some were
	     given Valium for anxiety efterwards.
<p>
	     On the whole, it seems that LSD is about as safe as a
	     drug can be, despite much propaganda saying otherwise.
