    <p><b>Shortly after taking off from Schiphol Airport, while climbing through 
      6,500 feet, the No. 3 engine separated with its pylon from the aircraft and 
      damaged the leading edge of the right wing. The No. 3 engine separated in such a 
      way that the No. 4 engine and pylon also separated from the wing. During an 
      attempted return to the airport, the aircraft crashed into a 11 story building 
      in the Bijlmermeer residential district. The design and certification of the 
      B-747 pylon was found to be inadequate to provide the required level of safety. 
      The system to ensure structural integrity by inspection failed. The separation 
      of the No. 3 engine was initiated by fatigue (corrosion) in the inboard midspar 
      fuse pin. This led to loss of the No. 4 engine and pylon and damage to several 
      systems which ultimately led to loss of control of the aircraft.</b></p>
