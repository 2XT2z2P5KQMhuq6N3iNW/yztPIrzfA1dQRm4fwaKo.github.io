  <br>
  <span class="style4"></span>The jet airliner crashed while attempting to land in heavy rain at Congonhas airport.<br>
The plane skidded off the end of the runway across a major roadway and struck a gas<br>
station and building, bursting into flames.  The right engine had a malfunctioning reverser.<br>
In this situation, the correct procedure was for the pilot to retard both throttles to idle<br>
and then advance both throttles to reverse, as if he had no problem with the reversers.<br>
The former procedure, which was changed by Airbus, was to take both throttles to idle,<br>
and then advance just the throttle corresponding to the engine with the operating reverser.<br>
It was changed by Airbus because there had been several incidents where the pilot forgot<br>
to bring both throttles back to idle, leaving one engine reversed and the other thrusting<br>
forward. The downside to this change was it would lengthen the stopping distance. The<br>
pilot was so concerned about the short and slippery runway that he chose to switch to <br>
the old procedure and got it wrong. A contributing factor was the heavy rain and wind<br>
and the fact that the newly resurfaced runway had not had grooves installed yet.</p>
