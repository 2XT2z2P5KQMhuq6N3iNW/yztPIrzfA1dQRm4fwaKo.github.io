   This list is compiled from a large number of sources, the main one being
   this newsgroup (ASH). I have not named anyone in any of the entries to
   ensure their privacy.
<p>
<i>   Calle: I, on the other hand, will name sources if (and only if) the
	  sources give me permission. 
</i>
   There may be inaccuracies in many of the entries... double check if you can.
   Go to the library and read up on your favorite method - check dosages in the
   manufacturer's data sheets. If you do notice any inaccuracies, please
   write to the net ASAP.

<a name="legal"><h3>Legal issues</h3></a>
   This file is provided for the purposes of amusement, and the actual use of
   any of these methods is not recommended without first considering other
   possibilities, such as dying of old age. Please do not pass it onto people
   whom you know to be actively suicidal.. you may find yourself in jail for
   considerable periods. I have a small amount of info on British law regarding
   assisting suicides; feel free to ask me for a copy. Basically, distribution
   to a number of unknown people is fine, but giving it to someone whom you
   know is actively considering suicide can get you into jail for up to 14
   years.
<p>
   I should also point out that this file is distributed world-wide, and there
   will be significant differences in the legal aspects in other
   countries.
<p>
<i>   Calle: For example, in Sweden the distribution of this file is
	  completely legal, according to a lawyer I know. As long as
	  you don't physically help someone to commit suicide, you're
	  safe. According to the lawyer mentioned above, Dr.
	  Kevorkian's suicide machine would probably be legal in
	  Sweden.
