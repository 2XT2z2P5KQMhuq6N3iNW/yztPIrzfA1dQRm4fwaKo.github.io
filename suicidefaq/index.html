<h1>Methods File</h1>

Hello, folks. This is the semi-famous alt.suicide.holiday Methods
File. It contains information on many different ways to take your own
life. Some of them are serious, some of them are not. Hopefully, you
can see which is which by yourself, but I'll try to mark them anyway. 
<p>
This file will be posted on the third and seventeenth of every month.
It may take a while before it gets out to your site.
<p>
The early versions of this file were created and maintained by Michael
Marsden, who unfortunately no longer has access to the Net. After he
left, the File sort of hung in a Limbo for a long time, in custody of
a variety of people I can't remember (if you at some time or other
were a maintainer of the File, I'd like to hear from you). I think,
but am far from sure, that Angela Watson (a.k.a. Psycho Kitten) was
the last "official" maintainer, but I got the impression that she no
longer is. 
<p>
Anyway, I have dictatorially taken over the custodianship of the
File. If you want to complain, my email address is <a href="mailto:calle@lysator.liu.se">calle@lysator.liu.se</a>. 
<p>
Comments on the content of the file are welcome, generally speaking.
If your comments are of the kind "You shouldn't help people kill
themselves, you should help them towards a better life instead", you're
wasting your time. I've grown very tired of that debate, and will most
probably no longer reply to mail with that general content. The most
basic difference in opinion between me and those who have mailed me
telling me I'm a monster, seems to be that they think that death is
an inherently Bad Thing, while I don't.
<p>
What follows is a not-so-slightly edited version of the last File
posted by Mike Marsden. The text's "I" is Mike, my comments will be
marked. <i>And so will mine. (<a href="http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/~ingvar/">Ingvar Mattsson</a>, HTML converter)</i>
