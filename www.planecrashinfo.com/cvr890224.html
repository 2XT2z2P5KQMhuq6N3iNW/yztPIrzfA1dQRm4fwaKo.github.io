<b>After leaving Honolulu, on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, 
the loss of an improperly latched foward lower lobe cargo door resulted in 
explosive decompression and loss of power in the No. 3 and 4 engines. Nine 
passengers were sucked out of the plane and lost at sea. The plane landed 
safely. The cargo door opening was attributed to a faulty switch or wiring in 
the door control system which permitted electrical actuation of the door latches 
towards the unlatched position after initial door closure and before takeoff.<br>
